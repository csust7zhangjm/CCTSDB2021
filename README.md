# CCTSDB2021 HELP
</p>In cctsdb 2021 dataset, there are 17856 images in training set and positive sample test set. The traffic signs in the image are divided into mandatory, prohibitory and warning according to their meanings.
</p>There are 16356 training set images numbered 00000-18991.
</p>The positive sample test set has 1500 images numbered 18992-20491.
</p>The "XML" compressed package stores the XML format annotation files of training set and positive sample test set.
</p>The "train_img" compressed package stores the training set images.
</p>The "train_labels" compressed package stores the TXT format annotation file of the training set.
</p>The "test_img" compressed package stores the positive sample test set image.
</p>The "classification based on weather and environment" compressed package stores the XML format annotation file of the positive sample test set classified according to the weather and lighting conditions.
</p>The "classification based on size of traffic signs" compressed package stores the XML format annotation file of the positive sample test set classified according to the size of traffic signs in the image.
</p>"Negative samples" contains 500 negative sample images.
